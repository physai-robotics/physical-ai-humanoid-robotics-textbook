# Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- **What is Physical AI?** - The integration of AI with robotic systems
- **The importance of embodiment** - How physical interaction shapes intelligence
- **Hardware-software co-design** - Building systems that leverage both
- **Course tools overview** - ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through robotic bodies. Unlike traditional software-only AI, Physical AI must:

1. **Perceive** the environment through sensors
2. **Learn** from physical interactions
3. **Act** through motors and actuators
4. **Adapt** to real-world constraints

## Key Concepts

### Embodiment

Embodiment is the principle that intelligence emerges from having a body that interacts with the world. A robot's morphology (shape and structure) directly influences how it perceives and learns.

### Hardware-Software Co-Design

Successful physical AI systems require close integration between:
- **Mechanical design** - Joint types, actuator capabilities
- **Sensory systems** - Vision, proprioception, tactile feedback  
- **Control software** - Real-time algorithms, decision-making
- **Learning systems** - Adaptation and optimization

## Tools We'll Use

### ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)
A flexible framework for robot software development providing:
- Publish-Subscribe messaging
- Service-based communication
- Tools for simulation and real robots

### Gazebo
A powerful physics simulator for robotics:
- Realistic physics simulation
- Multiple robot support
- Sensor simulation

### NVIDIA Isaac Sim
Advanced simulation and training platform:
- GPU-accelerated physics
- Photorealistic rendering
- Seamless sim-to-real transfer

## Discussion Questions

1. How does having a physical body change the nature of intelligence?
2. What are the challenges of deploying AI in the physical world?
3. How might a robot learn differently than a pure software AI system?

## Resources
